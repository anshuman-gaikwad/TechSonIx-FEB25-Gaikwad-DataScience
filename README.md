# Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation

## Description
This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model training on a dataset. The workflow includes:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting categorical data to numerical values.
- Scaling and normalizing features.
- Performing EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Training and evaluating three machine learning models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM).

## Setup and Running Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   OR
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab (for cloud execution)

## Features
- Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Label Encoding, Scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Correlation, Visualization)
- Model Training and Evaluation (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Performance Comparison using Accuracy, F1-score, and Classification Reports

## Future Plans
- Add more machine learning models like Random Forest and Neural Networks.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the trained model as an API or web application.

## Known Issues
- Model performance may vary based on dataset selection.
- Feature engineering improvements might enhance model accuracy.
